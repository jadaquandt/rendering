## Rendering Exercises -Jada Quandt

Here is a list of the comments I have in my code:

### renderSurveys.js ::
Things I had trouble with:
1. I had trouble rendering the text box 
2. I had trouble taking the code from class and merging it with my code

### renderAlbums.js :: 
Things I had trouble with:
1. This problem almost broke my brain. Just kidding, but it was a huge issue for me at first to wrap my head around getting to the deeply nested objects. So I broke them out and ran them that way, it worked and so to make them display correctly on the page, I figured out how to put them one after another that worked and I almost screamed with joy. After attending class on Thursday when we went over the surveys together, I realized I could've done it with multiple functions instead but since my code was working, I just decided to go ahead and submit.
2. I had some issues with some styling here but got it close enough so I just went with it

### renderTweets.js :: 
Things I had trouble with:
1. I set up a ternary operator ? to display the Verified badge if it was true but it didn't work for true but it would display for false? Couldn't figure it out but I had to move on to the other exercises.

### renderNametags.js :: 
Things I had trouble with:
1. I had Reena assist with getting the ternary operator to work with the styling for the Absent students. It was a good lesson though!

### Other exercises::
-Were pretty easy for me to grasp so no real problems.
